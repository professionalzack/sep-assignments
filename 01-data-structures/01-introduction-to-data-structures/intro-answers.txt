How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
> For the line it is fairly simple: if someone wanted to keep track of a queue for some reason, they can simply add and/or delete queue-sopt-holder. an example of this from my life is the uber airport queue. if i drive into a special parking lot near the airport, i am added to the end of the queue. as other drivers ahead of me leave the queue (either the first spot-holder picking up a fare, or a tired or impatient driver loggin off or leaving the area), i move forward in the queue. as far as the pixel screen, i suppose there is an application for programmers interested in a visual display, maybe even something animated? so they can move colored pixels, and everntually images, onto and off of the screen.
If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
the data structure is quite small, so they wouldnt have an issue. if it got larger, or if they wanted to try it out, i suppose they could use a search function? or perhaps they could use sql, as per the assignment last week.
What other real-world data can each structure represent?
i discussed the uber airport queue, but the line structure could easily be used for making a dagwood bumstead sandwich, with each new ingredient going in on top (end of the line) and him possibly deciding against something he'd already put in. the screen structure relays what color is present at any given point, but it could possibly be used to play a digital version of the boardgame, Battleship
